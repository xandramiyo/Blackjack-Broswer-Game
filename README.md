# BlackJack

This is your regular game of BlackJack. This game is played with a single deck that is shuffled at the start of every game. The player is given a wallet amount of $1000 in order to bet while playing. The current bet and the current "bank" amount is updated per round and the betting buttons become disabled once a bet is placed and the round has begun.

Once a bet has been made, the player and the "dealer" are dealt two cards, with the first of the dealer's cards being hidden. The player is able to hit or stay and the dealer will only act once the player either hits until their hand totals exactly 21 or they click the stay button. The game will also keep track of the number of games played in a current session, as well as how many times the player has won.

A message will be rendered at the end of every round to compare the two hands and display the winner. A unique message will also appear when the player is dealt a blackjack and the dealer's hand will be shown. The betting buttons will once again become active and the next game will start once a bet has been made. 

For those who are curious about the text and icon at the bottom of the table, I lightly themed my game around my favorite piece of fiction so it's a little easter egg for anyone who may recognize it.

## Future Enhancements

Add functionality for insurance in the case of possible dealer Blackjack. I would also like to add the options to split and double down.
