# BlackJack

This is a simple game of Blackjack that performs the minimum functionalities. This game is played with a single deck that is shuffled at the start of every game.

Once the play button is pressed, the player and the "dealer" are dealt two cards, with the first of the dealer's cards being hidden. The player is able to hit or stay and the dealer will only act once the player either hits until their hand totals exactly 21 or they click the stay button.

A message will also be rendered at the end of every round to compare the two hands and display the winner. A message may also appear when the player is dealt a blackjack, however, the dealer is still given a chance to push. Additionally, a button will be rendered alongside the message to allow the player to continue playing.

For those who are curious about the text and icon at the bottom of the table, I lightly themed my game around my favorite piece of fiction so it's a little easter egg for anyone who may recognize it.

## Possible Future Enhancements

The first possible enhancement is a feature that keeps track of player wins and losses. With this, I would also implement a tracker at the bottom of the screen to display the longest player win streak during the current session. 

The second enhancement would be to add gambling. This would also entail adding functions to allow the player to split, double down, and for the dealer to request insurance in the case that their opening hand is possibly a blackjack. 

Finally, I would include responsive design so that the game requires the browser window to be a certain minimum size.
